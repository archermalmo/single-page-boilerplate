        <h1>The angel investing landscape</h1>
        <p>
          Interest in angel investing is strong and growing quickly. According to the center for Venture Research, angel investments in 2011 totaled $22.5 billion, a 12.1% increase over 2010 investments. While there are  many reasons angels invest in startups, the most common motivations are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Enjoyment and personal satisfaction of mentoring or guiding young startups.</li>
          <li>Opportunities to meet intelligent, hardworking and diverse people.</li>
          <li>Achieve returns uncorrelated to public markets.</li>
          <li>Gain insight into innovation in your industry.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Contrary to popular belief successful investing is more than picking  &ldquo;winners&rdquo; and writing checks.  While many  angels may have a knack for picking good startup concepts or strong entrepreneurs, they lack the exposure to sufficient  investment opportunities and  thus cannot   objectively drive appropriate deal terms. Further, angels often lack the time, systems, network and experience to efficiently manage and assist the entrepreneur in successful early-stage company building.  Add to this the tax and legal headaches of a startup and the actual process of becoming and succeeding  as an angel investor is quite challenging and time consuming.
        </p>
        <p>
          The market opportunity is very large. Despite the high growth rates over the last several years, less than 3% of accredited investors have been active angels. It is our belief that many of these investors would join the movement if SVS is able to provide an easy to access platform for success in angel investing.
